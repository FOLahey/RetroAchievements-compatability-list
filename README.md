# RetroAchievements-compatability-list

- [RetroAchievements](retroachievements.com) is an amazing project for tracking progress and achievements in old games that did not have achievements before. 
- It is a community project led by volunteers.
- The project works by using the MD5 hash of the game ROM to identify the game on the RetroAchievements backend.
- Some ROMs have had version updates since being submitted. This is a compatability list of the games that I am identifying that are not using the newest hash in RetroAchievements, so either they can be updated in RetroAchievements eventually, or users can prioritize searching for the older versions of a ROM that has been registered and made compatible with RetroAchievements.
